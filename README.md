# aka-browser

A lightweight, elegant web browser for developers featuring an iPhone frame interface.

## Project Goals

**aka-browser** is designed specifically for web developers who need a beautiful, lightweight alternative to heavy mobile simulators. Built as a Mac application using Electron, it provides an iPhone-framed browsing experience without the performance overhead of full-featured simulators like Xcode's iPhone Simulator.

### Why aka-browser?

While Xcode's iPhone Simulator offers a polished interface, it comes with significant drawbacks:
- **High memory consumption** that impacts system performance
- **CPU-intensive operations** causing laptop heating and fan noise
- **Overkill functionality** when you only need to preview web content

aka-browser addresses these pain points by offering:
- **Lightweight performance** - minimal resource usage for extended development sessions
- **Elegant design** - a beautiful iPhone frame interface perfect for working in cafes or public spaces
- **Developer-focused** - streamlined for web development workflows without unnecessary simulator features

### Development Approach

This project takes a pragmatic approach to browser development:
- Built on **Electron** framework, customized to function as a web browser
- Focus on **usability over completeness** - aiming for a functional, practical tool rather than a full-featured browser
- Iterative development prioritizing core features that matter to web developers

### Target Audience

Web developers who want:
- A visually appealing mobile preview tool for their projects
- Low system resource usage during development
- A portable, cafe-friendly development environment
- Quick mobile viewport testing without simulator overhead
