## 🎯 Why aka-browser?

**aka-browser** isn't here to replace your main browser—it's designed to work **alongside it**.

Think of it as your **always-on-top companion** for those moments when you need a second screen but don't have one.

## 📦 Installation & Development

### Prerequisites

| Requirement      | Version | Purpose                           |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Node.js**      | 18+     | Runtime environment               |
| **pnpm**         | Latest  | Package management (recommended)  |
| **Python 3**     | 3.8+    | EVS signing for DRM builds        |
| **Castlabs EVS** | -       | Production DRM signing (optional) |

### Building for Production

Want to watch Netflix? You'll need a production build:

```bash
# 1️⃣ Setup EVS signing (first time only)
pnpm run evs:setup

# 2️⃣ Verify your configuration
pnpm run evs:verify

# 3️⃣ Build the packaged app
pnpm run package
```

> **⚠️ Important**: Netflix and other streaming services **reject development mode** signatures. You **must** use a packaged build for DRM content.

## 🎬 DRM Content Playback

aka-browser supports **Widevine DRM** out of the box:

```
Development Mode  →  ❌ Netflix won't work
Production Build  →  ✅ Full DRM support (L3 level, software-based without TEE)
```

### How It Works

1. **Widevine CDM** auto-downloads on first run (via Electron Component Updater)
2. **Castlabs EVS** signs the app for production-grade DRM validation
3. **Streaming services** verify the signature and allow playback

### Supported Services

| Service               | Status | Notes                         |
| --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| 🍿 **Netflix**        | ✅     | Requires production build     |
| 🏰 **Disney+**        | ✅     | Requires production build     |
| 📦 **Prime Video**    | ✅     | Requires production build     |
| 🎵 **Spotify**        | ✅     | Works in dev mode             |
| 🎬 **Other Widevine** | ✅     | Most require production build |
